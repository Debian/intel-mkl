* what are the interfaces/ files used for??
  https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-linux-developer-guide-high-level-directory-structure
* benchmark directory is filtered. debian package hpcc seems to ship
  some files in that directory. Check it and recommend/suggest hpcc.
* check license for all files
* write pkgconfig file for MKL. Debian's mkl package doesn't retain the
  upstream directory structure, but modifying upstream pkgconfig is not
  allowed.
  at the same time, drop the upstream pkgconfig
