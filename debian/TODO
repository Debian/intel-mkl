* iomp5 is filtered. Which MKL library depends on it?? it seems that MKL
  is working without the fake libiomp5 package??
  deal with the iomp / gomp / mpich / openmpi / tbb dependencies.
* what are the interfaces/ files used for??
  https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-linux-developer-guide-high-level-directory-structure
* benchmark directory is filtered. debian package hpcc seems to ship
  some files in that directory. Check it and recommend/suggest hpcc.
* db_purge on dpkg --purge seems to be automatically handled by dh_installdebconf.
  test it.
* recommend doc package.
* check license for all files
* is the message catalog file installed to the right place?
* change header install dir.
* provide libblas.so and header again.
* write pkgconfig file for MKL. Debian's mkl package doesn't retain the
  upstream directory structure, but modifying upstream pkgconfig is not
  allowed.
  at the same time, drop the upstream pkgconfig
