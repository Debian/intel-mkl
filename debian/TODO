* [minor] should we conflict with the MKL packages came from Intel's APT
  channel? I think there is no need to do that. Upstream .deb packages
  install stuff to /opt . There is no conflict.

* remove multiarch triplet from debconf options. Once selected, it works
  for all architectures.

* there is still a corner case where there is only MKL as the only
  multiarch libblas.so.3 provider.

* [important] merge the pkg-config files into the header package. The
  common headers won't conflict as long as they have the same checksum
  as that from another architecture.
