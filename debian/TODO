* [cantfix] Performance on AMD CPUs.
  MKL looks specific to Intel CPUs.

* [wontfix] should we conflict with the MKL packages came from Intel's APT
  channel? I think there is no need to do that. Upstream .deb packages
  install stuff to /opt . There is no conflict.

* [wontfix] move headers out from directory /usr/include/mkl, to /usr/include.
  I think we'd better not move the headers to the public space. The MKL
  library ships fftw3 header, which is installed at

      /usr/include/mkl/fftw/fftw3.h

  And the above location won't cause any confusion, compared to

      /usr/include/fftw/fftw3.h  (from: libmkl-dev)
      /usr/include/fftw3.h       (from: libfftw3-dev)

  If we move the MKL headers out from a private directory.
