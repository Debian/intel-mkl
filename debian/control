Description: Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) (Dev)
 Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) is a computing math library of highly
 optimized, extensively threaded routines for applications that require
 maximum performance. The library provides Fortran and C programming language
 interfaces. Intel MKL C language interfaces can be called from applications
 written in either C or C++, as well as in any other language that can
 reference a C interface.
 .
 Intel MKL provides comprehensive functionality support in these major areas
 of computation:
 .
  * BLAS (level 1, 2, and 3) and LAPACK linear algebra routines, offering
    vector, vector-matrix, and matrix-matrix operations.
  * ScaLAPACK distributed processing linear algebra routines, as well as the
    Basic Linear Algebra Communications Subprograms (BLACS) and the Parallel
    Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (PBLAS).
  * Intel MKL PARDISO (a direct sparse solver based on Parallel Direct Sparse
    Solver PARDISO*), an iterative sparse solver, and supporting sparse BLAS
    (level 1, 2, and 3) routines for solving sparse systems of equations, as
    well as a distributed version of Intel MKL PARDISO solver provided for
    use on clusters.
  * Fast Fourier transform (FFT) functions in one, two, or three dimensions
    with support for mixed radices (not limited to sizes that are powers of 2),
    as well as distributed versions of these functions provided for use on
    clusters.
  * Vector Mathematics (VM) routines for optimized mathematical operations
    on vectors.
  * Vector Statistics (VS) routines, which offer high-performance vectorized
    random number generators (RNG) for several probability distributions,
    convolution and correlation routines, and summary statistics functions.
  * Data Fitting Library, which provides capabilities for spline-based
    approximation of functions, derivatives and integrals of functions, and
    search.
  * Extended Eigensolver, a shared memory programming (SMP) version of an
    eigensolver based on the Feast Eigenvalue Solver.
  * Deep Neural Network (DNN) primitive functions with C language interface.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries for development.
